# AI/Copilot Usage Disclosure
Hi! If you're reading this, chances are you're curious about *how* AI tools were used in the creation of this project. I figured a process-based/journal style disclosure where I write and update this in real-time as I work on the project would be more insightful than a static summary at the end — maybe it'll help you feel like you're coding along with me, or give you the fun experience of watching an aspiring junior candidate bumble around trying to work out coding interview questions? :D

Anyways, here goes!

## AI Tools Used:
- *GitHub Copilot*: Used primarily for code suggestions and boilerplate generation.
- *Claude*: Used primarily for brainstorming and debugging.
- *ChatGPT*: Used primarily when Claude rate limit is hit (lol), when Claude answers appear suboptimal (feel "off") and I want a "second opinion", or when a task is too "simple" to justify using up my Claude quota (e.g. boilerplate, simple refactors).

## Project Conceptualization
### Prompt: *[Paste Entire Project Requirement]*
- Reasoning: I wanted to get a high-level overview of the project requirements before diving in, and check out what the "average, standardized solution" would be in terms of layout and presentation — just to make sure I'm envisioning more or less the same thing.
- Outcome: Claude generated a simple homepage with a logo and an anime search bar. Very barebones and search was broken (as expected, since i didn't provide any API details), but it gave me a baseline to work against and some code to look through. Mainly it just helped me feel less intimidated about taking on this coding challenge to begin with. (Never done one before, first times are scary!)
