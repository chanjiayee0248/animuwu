# AnimUwU — Your Friendly Anime Search Pal!
## Powered by Jikan API | Look up your favourite animes!
Made with 💙 for a coding take home project.

A small React + TypeScript single-page app that lets users search anime and view detailed pages using the Jikan API (unofficial MyAnimeList API). 
- This project follows the mini-project requirements: 
- React hooks
- TypeScript
- react-router
- Redux for state
- Server-side pagination
- Instant search with 250ms debouncing + request cancellation.

### Key goals:
Fast, responsive instant search (debounced + cancels in-flight requests).
Server-side pagination for search results.
Accessible detail pages with rich metadata.
Clean TypeScript types and modular code.
